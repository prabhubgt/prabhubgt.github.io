  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><small>Last updated: 07 Sep 2025</small></p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Simple Shop (“the App”) helps you create invoices, manage products and customers, and generate reports. Your business data is stored locally on your device. Optional cloud backup/restore uses your Google Drive account with your consent. We do not operate servers to store your content.</p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Business data (invoices, products, customers)</strong>: Stored locally on your device. Not sent to our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Drive (optional)</strong>: If you sign in and choose backup/restore, the App uploads/reads backup files in your Google Drive App Data folder (scope: <code>drive.file</code>).</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising</strong>: The App may show Google AdMob ads. AdMob may collect device identifiers and ad interaction data per Google’s policies.</li>
    <li><strong>In‑App Purchases</strong>: Purchases (e.g., Remove Ads) are processed by Google Play Billing. We receive purchase tokens and acknowledgements from Google to unlock features; we do not receive payment card details.</li>
    <li><strong>Crash/Diagnostics (if enabled by Google/Device)</strong>: Platform-level analytics may provide aggregate crash information. We do not collect personal analytics ourselves.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide core features (billing, inventory, reports) locally on your device.</li>
    <li>Perform backup and restore operations to your Google Drive only when you request it.</li>
    <li>Show ads via AdMob unless you purchase the “Remove Ads” option.</li>
    <li>Verify and unlock premium features using Google Play Billing purchase status.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third‑Party Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Play Billing</strong> – for in‑app purchases (Remove Ads).</li>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> – for displaying ads (disabled when you purchase Remove Ads).</li>
    <li><strong>Google Drive API</strong> – for optional backup/restore to your account.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Network</strong>: To show ads (when enabled), verify purchases, and perform Drive backups.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage/Files</strong>: To generate and share PDFs/CSVs and maintain local backups.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Account (Sign‑in)</strong>: Optional; used only to access your Google Drive for backup/restore.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Retention & Control</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your business data remains on your device unless you explicitly back it up to Google Drive.</li>
    <li>You may delete backup files from Google Drive at any time via your Google account.</li>
    <li>Uninstalling the App deletes local data stored by the App on your device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data within the App. Backups, if enabled, are stored in your Google Drive under your account. No backend servers controlled by us store your business content.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is intended for business use and not directed to children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the App without signing in to Google; features continue to work offline.</li>
    <li>Purchase “Remove Ads” to disable advertising and the PDF footer stamp.</li>
    <li>Delete your Google Drive backups at any time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Updates will be posted at this page with a new “Last updated” date.</p>
